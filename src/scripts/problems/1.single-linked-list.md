   - *Create a linked-list by traversing common elements*
1. [X] Intersection point of two Linked Lists.
   - *Find lengths of both the Linked-List*
   - *Traverse the difference length of the greater LL*

1. [X] Reverse a linked list
   ```java
    while(current!=null){
        next = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    *head = prev;
    ```
